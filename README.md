# Please read first



- First make sure you have the license file and the bundle zipped file in your root folder and that they have the correct names
- start both nodes with "docker-compose up"
- ./copyLicense.sh (if it hasn't been copied; it should have been automatically copied)
- connect to both nodes, start node one, see that it works, and then start node 2





# Troubleshooting

- If the Liferay zipped bundle hasn't been copied correctly or unziped correctly, problems will arise (you can copy them again any time)
- Make sure your database and shared folders are clean before you start
